# TLDR
Use the GCC `__attribute__((section("...")))` to place (*from many different places in your code*) data into a global `array`. Final code is [here](#final-code).

# The Attribute Section Story

Some time ago, I encountered a tricky problem in C. I needed to push data into an array from all over my code. Not just when the code flow eventually reached a location, but instantly at program start.

I was sure there must be a solutionâ€”and there is!

**`__attribute__((section("...")))` to the rescue!!!**

**`__attribute__(...)`**: is a way in GCC and Clang to tell the compiler specifics about how to handle data or functions. There is a great list of all possible attributes [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Attributes.html).

**`section("...")`**: refers to `elf section`. When you compile your code into an executable, the resulting binary is packed into a binary format - namely `elf` on a linux system. This `elf` file will have some predefined sections like `.text` `.bss` [and so on](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_5.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/specialsections.html). But you are not limited to this sections. GCC allows you to create your own sections for your *special* data.

For my case I wanted to collect many `struct MyMetaData {...}` instances in a `MetaDataSection` section. Then, at program start, this data would be somehow processed. Later when the program arrives at the place *where* this struct is actually created, it would simply ignore it. 

All this collecting data into a section can be easily done by adding `__attribute__((section("MyMetaDataSection")))` to every variable declaration.

# Placing Data in a Section

Placing (pushing) data into an elf section is done by adding the `__attribute__((section(...)))` to the variable definition. 

```C
/* place the variable FOO in MySection */
int  __attribute__((section("MySection"))) FOO = 4;
```

Conveniently, the linker will automatically create two symbols for us: `__start_MySection` and `__stop_MySection`. This symbols are placed at the begin and end of section. 
<div class="warning">
NOTE: this symbols are **NOT** pointers to the start/stop,themselves are located at the positions!! Since the symbols are created by the linker we do not see them during compilation.
So we need to declare them ourselves:
</div>

```C
/* place the variable FOO in MySection */
int  __attribute__((section("MySection"))) FOO = 4;

/* declare the __start and __stop markers of our new section.
 * remember to make them extern otherwise we will create two variables instead. */
extern int __start_MySection;
extern int __start_MySection;
```

To access the data in the section, simply look at all the data in between the `__start...` and `__stop...` marker.

```C
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/* place the variable FOO in MySection */
int  __attribute__((section("MySection"))) FOO = 0x4;
int  __attribute__((section("MySection"))) BAR = 0x8;
int  __attribute__((section("MySection"))) BAZ = 0x10;

/* declare the __start and __stop markers of our new section.
 * remember to make them extern otherwise we will create two variables instead. */
extern int __start_MySection;
extern int __stop_MySection;

int main() {
	/* create a pointer -> to the first element in the section */
	int *i = &__start_MySection;

	/* go through every element in the section */
	for (;i < &__stop_MySection; i++) {
		printf("i:%d\n",*i);
	}

	/* only global data can be put in a section. 
	 * static will put a variable lifetime in global scope
	 */
	static int  __attribute__((section("MySection"))) FAZ = 0x20;

	return 0;
}
```
Compile and run it and voila:

```ignore
$ ./a.out 
 i:4
 i:8
 i:16
 i:32
```

# Setting the Data Layout

Now that we can collect our data from all over the code, let's change the example to use `structs`.

<div class="warning">
NOTE: bad example, do not use the following code!
</div>

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

struct MetaData {
	char name[32];
	int id;
};

/* place the variable STRUCT_FOO in MySection */
struct MetaData STRUCT_FOO __attribute__((section("MyStructSection"))) = {
	.name = "FOO",
	.id = 1
};

struct MetaData STRUCT_BAR __attribute__((section("MyStructSection"))) = {
	.name = "BAR",
	.id = 2
};

struct MetaData STRUCT_BAZ __attribute__((section("MyStructSection"))) = {
	.name = "BAZ",
	.id = 3
};


/* declare the __start and __stop markers of our new section.
 * remember to make them extern otherwise we will create two variables instead. */
extern struct MetaData __start_MyStructSection;
extern struct MetaData __stop_MyStructSection;

int main() {
	/* create a pointer -> to the first element in the section */
	struct MetaData *i = &__start_MyStructSection;

	/* go through every element in the section */
	for (;i < &__stop_MyStructSection; i++) {
		printf("0x%x name:%s id:%d\n",i, i->name, i->id);
	}

	/* only global data can be put in a section. 
	* static will put a variable lifetime in global scope
	*/
	static struct MetaData STRUCT_FAZ __attribute__((section("MyStructSection"))) = {
		.name = "FAZ",
		.id = 4
	};

	return 0;
}
```

Compile and run it and **BAM**:

```ignore
 $ ./a.out 
0x403020 name:FOO id:1
0x403044 name: id:0
0x403068 name: id:0
0x40308c name: id:0
0x4030b0 name: id:0
0x4030d4 name: id:0
0x4030f8 name: id:0
```

Ok, clearly something went wrong. So lets do some **debugging**

# Some Debugging

First, lets check the size of our struct:
```
$ gdb ./a.out -ex="p sizeof(struct MetaData)" -ex="q"
...
$1 = 36
```
Looking at the program output, we see that the loop indeed steps `36(0x24) bytes`. It seems the `__start...` and `__stop..` symbol are farer apart as we would expect?! 

Hex-dumping[^HEXDUMP] the complete section will reveal the mystery:

[^HEXDUMP]: objdump allows us to specify only a specific section to hexdump. Same could have been done with any other hexdump or re tool. 

```ignore
$ objdump -s -j MyStructSection  a.out 

a.out:     file format elf64-x86-64

```

All our structs are actually `64(0x40) bytes` apart! This is due to optimizations GCC does to `global` variables. 

But we want our section to be layout like in an array. And that we can iterate with a pointer over all entries. This can be done by forcing the compiler to align all or structs, as it would align them in an array. The `alignof` compiler builtin will tell us what the default (and also Array) alignment of a type is. And with the `__attribute__((aligned(...)))` we set the alignment of or structs to that specific value: `__attribute__((aligned(alignof(struct MetaData))))`

# Final Code

Adding this second attribute will definitely make the code unreadable. so lets create a macro for that.

And while we are at it lets also add the third and fourth requirement. 
- Prevent the compiler from striping the data by marking it as being used with `__attribute((used))` 
- Hide the variable names to prevent the names from cluttering the global namespace[^namespace] `__attribute((visibility ("hidden")))`.

[^namespace]: namespace in the sense of a c link unit, not a C++ namespace.

Luckily we can combine all attributes: 

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define META_DATA_SECTION __attribute__(( \
	/* place the data into META_DATA_SECTION */ \
	section("META_DATA_SECTION"), \
	/* do not insert empty space between elements */ \
	aligned(alignof(struct MetaData)), \
	/* mark this data as used so the compiler will not remove it */ \
	used, \
	/* optionally hide the variable name from other parts of the code */ \
	visibility ("hidden") \
)) 

/* our actual payload data */
struct MetaData {
  char name[32];
  int id;
};


/* now create a MetaData point and push it to META_DATA_SECTION */
struct MetaData _MY_DATA_1 META_DATA_SECTION = {
	.name = "foo", 
	.id = 0xc0ffe
};
struct MetaData _MY_DATA_2 META_DATA_SECTION = {
	.name = "bar", 
	.id = 0xdead
};

/* we can also use this in a function */
void function_a() {
	/* only global or static variables can be pushed to a section. */
	static struct MetaData _MY_DATA_XX META_DATA_SECTION = {
		.name = __FILE__, 
		.id = 0xc0de
	};
}

/**
 * to access the data we need this external symbols the linker
 * will automatically create symbols for a section called __start_SECTION_NAME 
 * and __stop_SECTION_NAME however to satisfy the compiler we still need to 
 * declare the symbols as external here
 **/
extern struct MetaData __start_META_DATA_SECTION;
extern struct MetaData __stop_META_DATA_SECTION;

int main() {
	/**
	 * the __start symbol will be located (and not pointing!!) at the start of
	 * the section. Therefor we take its &address here which will point to the
	 * first element in the section.
	 **/
	struct MetaData* iter = &__start_META_DATA_SECTION;

	/**
	 * now we iterate over all elements until we reach the end of the section
	 **/
	for (; iter < &__stop_META_DATA_SECTION; iter++) {
		printf("0x%x {name:%s,id:0x%x}\n",iter,  iter->name, iter->id);
	}

}


struct MetaData _MY_DATA_3 META_DATA_SECTION = {
	.name = "baz", 
	.id = 0xc0de
};

```
we run it and **YES** it works!

```ignore
$ ./a.out 
0x40300c {name:foo,id:0xc0ffe}
0x403030 {name:bar,id:0xdead}
0x403054 {name:sections.c,id:0xc0de}
0x403078 {name:baz,id:0xc0de}
```
